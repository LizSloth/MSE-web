Taken by all first -year undergraduates, this foundationa l course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyse texts.

In class, students will practice how to come to a question to which they do not have an answe r, and, after a review of presentation skills, students will present their discoveries to the class. Eventually, students will be asked to find two sources that can help them compose an argument that responds to their question. The final goal is to draft a n op -ed (short for \u201copposite the editorial page\u201d), a piece of writing usually found in a newspaper or magazine that expresses the author\u2019s argument on a current topic. Students\u2019 op -eds will be peer workshopped and revised substantially over two to three we eks. Students will also consult with their teacher and receive individual feedback on their draft.

The virtual lab in this course offers vivid instruction in the most widely practiced equipment for materials evaluation such as x-ray diffraction (XRD). Due to the limited access of undergraduate students to the above popular equipment, the virtual lab allows students to operate such equipment and explore various functions anytime outside the classroom, arousing interest by hands-on operation and enhancing understanding of the theoretical knowledge.  The goal is to provide you with a foundation in the use of characterization techniques to diagnose and solve material problems that can be identified and potentially resolved in their forthcoming final year project and future research experience.",
